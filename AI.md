# Posty5 JavaScript SDK - AI Entry Point

> New feature? It ships with an article, a guide page, and SDK + MCP coverage when it has a public API — see [`../AI_RULES.md`](../AI_RULES.md) §14.

> **Hard limits** — they outrank every other instruction, plan, checklist and
> skill ([`AI_RULES.md`](../AI_RULES.md) §0):
>
> - **No test suite without the user's approval.** Never run `jest`,
>   `ng test`, `vitest`, `turbo run test`, `npm test` / `pnpm test` or
>   `dotnet test` on your own — not after each change, not as a final check.
>   Ask in chat first (which suite, which project, why) and wait for a clear
>   yes; one yes covers one run.
> - **At most three sub-agents at once.** Run a larger fan-out in waves of
>   three.

This repository is the npm workspaces TypeScript SDK monorepo. Eight publishable JavaScript/TypeScript packages sharing a core HTTP client and typed clients for Posty5 links, QR codes, hosting, form submissions, variables, and social publishing.

## Required reading order

1. `AI_CONTEXT/00_START_HERE.md`
2. `AI_CONTEXT/14_AI_TASK_ROUTING.md`
3. `AI_CONTEXT/13_CHANGE_PLAYBOOK.md`
4. `AI_CONTEXT/FILE_INDEX.json`
5. `AI_CONTEXT/MODULE_INDEX.json`
6. `AI_CONTEXT/FEATURE_INDEX.json`

## Hard rules

- Use exact paths from the indexes; verify with search when an item is not indexed.
- Read `AI_CONTEXT/15_RISKY_AREAS.md` before changing security, compatibility, deployment, uploads, SSR, permissions, or public APIs.
- Never copy secret values into code, logs, documentation, fixtures, or chat output.
- Do not edit generated/local artifacts described in `AI_CONTEXT/03_FOLDER_MAP.md`.
- Run the build/lint checks in `AI_CONTEXT/11_LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`. The test suites in `AI_CONTEXT/12_TESTING_DEBUGGING.md` run only after the user approves in chat (see Hard limits above).
- Update the matching Markdown and JSON indexes whenever architecture, routes/API, config, integrations, modules, features, or patterns change.

Project context is local to `npm-sdk/`; sibling repositories have their own rules.
